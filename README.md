## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

The development of this project was very important, with each new challenge, you always learn something new. I put TypeScript into practice for the first time, and I perceived its organizational and intuitive power. I also learned about another JavaScript resource, such as the clipboard, and applied its utility.

### Continued development

I intend to keep studying, strengthen my programming foundations even more, and achieve the highest possible versatility. I will continue to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript, and the React ecosystem.
